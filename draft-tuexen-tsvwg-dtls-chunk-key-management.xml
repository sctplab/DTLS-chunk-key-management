<abstract>
<t>This document defines how Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) 1.3
is used to establish keys for securing SCTP using the DTLS Chunk mechanism.
It specifies how a DTLS handshake is used to establish the initial security
context for an SCTP association and describes procedures for key updates and
post-handshake authentication. The goal is to enable authenticated,
and confidential communication over SCTP using the DTLS Chunk,
leveraging standardized DTLS features for key management and rekeying.</t>

<name>Introduction</name>
<t>The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a transport protocol
designed to support message-oriented communication with features such as
multi-streaming and multi-homing.
In many deployments, particularly those telecommunication networks and WebRTC
data channels, it is essential to provide confidentiality, integrity, and peer
authentication for SCTP traffic.</t>
<t><xref target="RFC6083"/> defines a mechanism for securing SCTP by
encapsulating it over DTLS 1.0/1.2, establishing a secure channel between
SCTP endpoints.
However, with the introduction of DTLS 1.3 <xref target="RFC9147"/>, the
protocol underwent significant changes, including removal of renegotiation,
a new key schedule, and support for post-handshake operations.
Without additional description, RFC 6083 cannot be used with DTLS 1.3.</t>
<t>Additionally, <xref target="I-D.westerlund-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk"/> defines
a new method for secure and confidential transfer for SCTP packets but leaves
key management to a separate specification.</t>
<t>This document complements <xref target="I-D.westerlund-tsvwg-sctp-dtls-chunk"/>
by specifying how DTLS 1.3 is used to derive and manage the cryptographic keys
required for use with the DTLS Chunk, addressing key management aspects not
covered in that specification. Specifically, it describes:</t>
<ul>
<li><t>How the DTLS 1.3 handshake establishes the initial security context
between SCTP endpoints.</t></li>
<li><t>How keying material is derived and associated with the
SCTP association.</t></li>
<li><t>How DTLS 1.3 features, such as key updates and post-handshake
authentication, are leveraged to support long-lived secure sessions.</t></li>
</ul>
<t>The goal of this specification is to modernize and extend the approach defined
in RFC 6083, aligning it with the architectural and cryptographic changes introduced
in DTLS 1.3, while enabling a cleaner and more efficient integration with native
SCTP functionality.</t>

<name>Architecture</name>
<t>This document describes how Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) 1.3 is
used to establish keys for securing SCTP using the DTLS Chunk. This approach
combines the performance and encryption flexibility of DTLS Chunks with the
integrated key management capabilities of DTLS. The resulting solution
can be viewed from two perspectives: as a new key management method for
SCTP, and as an SCTP-specific encryption layer integrated with DTLS.</t>

<t>The key characteristics of the solution are as follows:</t>
<ul>
<li><t>Application data is protected using DTLS Chunks.</t></li>
<li><t>The DTLS handshake is used to establish keying material, algorithms,
and parameters for use with DTLS Chunks.</t></li>
<li><t>DTLS and relevant extensions are used to negotiate cryptographic
algorithms and parameters, perform extended key updates, enable larger
record sizes, and support post-handshake authentication.</t></li>
<li><t>All other DTLS record-layer content types are protected using
standard DTLS record framing.</t></li>
</ul>

<t>Application data is never transmitted in DTLS record-layer application_data
records. Instead, application data is passed to the DTLS stack, which forwards
it to the Record Protection Operator. The operator encapsulates the data into
DTLS Chunks, applying appropriate protection.</t>

<t>Any data that is not part of a DTLS Chunk MUST use standard DTLS record-layer
framing and MUST be sent in separate datagrams.</t>

<t>The figure below illustrates the architecture, highlighting the
role of the upper-layer protocol (ULP), which acts as the consumer of
SCTP's transport services. The ULP may interface directly with the SCTP
library or operate through the DTLS 1.3 stack. This specification builds
upon DTLS 1.3 by introducing additional extensions to support enhanced
functionality, including post-handshake authentication as described in
<xref target="RFC9261"/> and the extended key update mechanism defined
in <xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-extended-key-update"/>.</t>

<t>Following the initial SCTP association setup, a DTLS 1.3 handshake
is performed to mutually authenticate the endpoints and to derive keying
material for the DTLS Chunk Protection Operator. The TLS exporter, as
defined in Section 7.5 of <xref target="RFC8446"/>, is used to derive
this keying material. It leverages the same cryptographic algorithms
that were negotiated during the DTLS handshake for use with the DTLS
Record Layer, thereby eliminating the need for separate algorithm
negotiation for the DTLS Chunk. However, this approach requires that
only algorithm suites compatible with both DTLS 1.3 and DTLS Chunks be
configured and supported.</t>

<section>
<name>Setting the Keys Initially</name>
<t>Describe how the keys are derived from the DTLS master key and set.</t>
</section>

<section>
<name>Updating the Keys</name>
<t>Describe how the extended key update specified in
<xref target='I-D.ietf-tls-extended-key-update'/> is used.
In particular, describe when the new receive key is installed, the new send
key is installed and how the old receive key is removed. Same for the restart
keys. Describe how the key derivation is done.</t>
</section>

<section>
<name>Post-Handshake Authentication</name>
<t>
SCTP peers may require periodic re-authentication after the DTLS
handshake has completed. This is needed, for example, to demonstrate
continued possession of a private key. In such cases, peers
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> use the post-handshake authentication mechanism
defined in <xref target="RFC9261"/>.
</t>
<t>
The application-layer protocol running over DTLS
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be used to transmit the Authenticator Request.
Either the SCTP client or the SCTP server may initiate this request
using the established DTLS connection.
</t>
<t>
Similarly, the application-layer protocol running over DTLS
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be used to transmit the corresponding
Authenticator message.
</t>
<t>
TBD: A description of the application-layer message format(s) that
carry the Authenticator Request and Authenticator will be provided
in a future revision.
